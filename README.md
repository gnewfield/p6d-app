## Novel dApp for password management

While traditional password managers store your passwords locally on your device or remotely on a centralized server, p6d never stores your passwords anywhere. It uses your private key, the access code to your crypto wallet that you should not share with anyone, to generate your password for a website each time you use it. 

Password management is one of the least secure facets of the internet today. A lack of innovation has led every website to need numbers, special characters, and capital letters in your passwords. Websites put the onus of security onto their users. Itâ€™s easier for them to recover your stolen account than design a more secure system. The current method leaves users vulnerable to security risks. 

I find it absurd that websites expect every user to personally manage and secure 10s or 100s of passwords without repeating them. Your crypto wallet is your passport to web3 sites. p6d extends that passport to the rest of the internet.

Beta is live! Please try it out. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!
